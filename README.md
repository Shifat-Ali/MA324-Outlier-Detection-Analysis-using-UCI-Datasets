# Outlier-Detection-Analysis-using-UCI-Datasets

### Description

This repository contains code and documentation for a semester project (MA 324) focusing on outlier detection techniques applied to publicly available datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project explores the identification of influential points and leverage points within datasets using various algorithms and methodologies.

### Key Features

- Outlier detection using methods such as Cook's Distance, Isolation Forest.
- Analysis of influential points and leverage points within datasets.
- Utilization of popular UCI datasets for experimentation and evaluation.
- Easily reproducible code for others to explore and extend.
